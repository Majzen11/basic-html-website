# Basic HTML Website
Roadmap.sh project: Basic HTML Website

Project-URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website

## URL for final project:
https://majzen11.github.io/basic-html-website/

## Key requirements for this project:

In this project, you are required to create a simple HTML only website with multiple pages. The website should have following pages:

Homepage
Projects
Articles
Contact

The website should have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages.

You are not required to style the website, you are only required to create the structure of the website using HTML. Goals of this project are:

- Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
- Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.

## My thoughts on this project

I found it difficult personalise this project, so I stuck with the example text from the project for now. For the pages that didn'r have an example I just made up some silly text as a placeholder. Maybe when I continue with the styling I can make it more my own. 

I feel like I'm getting a good grasp of the basic HTML concepts. I think I understand how to write good semantic HTML, though I'm sure I still have a lot to learn. While doing this project, though it wasnt exaclty relevant, I read up on the differences between <section> and <article> and how they can sometimes be used almost interchangeably. This is still a bit confusing, but I'm sure I will get the hang of it eventually. I didn't feel it appropriate to use the <article> tag in this project. I also discovered that the <header> and <footer> tags can be used more than onece on a page, which was not how I had understood them before. I thought they were only for the top and bottom of the page, but it turns out they can be used for headers/footers within an article as well. There are still more semantic tags that I need to learn how to use and also how often to use them. 

I also still need to get the <meta> tags under my skin. I haven't used them enough to really remember them yet. 

I'm looking forward to the next project which is adding style to this one. I know that will be a lot more fun!
